\section{Creating a Synthetic Alignment Dataset}

icassp2016optimizing3

Add CQT comparison of corrupted and uncorrupted, and warping path.

\section{Optimizing DTW-Based Alignment}

icassp2016optimizing4

Add figure of estimated warping path and error.

\section{Optimizing Confidence Reporting}

icassp2016optimizing5

Add figure of normalized DTW distance vs. alignment error.

\section{Qualitative Evaluation of Real-World Data}

\section{Remaining Issues}

Not enough separation between different ratings.
The goal (feature representation) for alignment is different than the goal for confidence reporting.
There are still more dimensions to explore.
DTW is still way to slow to do the large-scale matching problem.
